Prompt 1:

Task here is to build a simple system.

system structure:
- the top level module is core/core_simple_ppu.v which will be wired in apf/apf_top.v.
- It contains a pixel process unit(PPU) which contains a very simple instruction set. (eg. drawing a line, drawing a polygon, fill with color, etc)
- The PPU should drive a 320x288 pixel rgb display. (same as core_top_basic_asset.v)
- SDRam is available for you to use(see core_top_basic_asset for examples)
- It contains a simple control unit which read instruction files(bin file) from external storage and sent the commands to PPU to render on startup

Context:
The device is analogue pocket. The user manual is in analogue_pocket_manual folder
core_top_basic_asset and core_top_ngy.v provides examples on how to interact with the hardware.

Ask me any clarification questions before start implementing.


Prompt 2:

Refactor core_simple_ppu.v into seprate modules.
All modules should be under core/simple_ppu execept core_simple_ppu.v itself.
sub modules:
1. ppu.v: the ppu itself.
2. cpu.v: the tiny controller that load bin file to ram and send commands to ppu.
3. sd ram or external file control logic module. you can use your own judgement here. 
The goal is to make the files more readable and not too big.

Prompt 3:
Now let's test the ppu alone without loading bin file.
create a new core core_top_simple_ppu_no_bin_file.v
This core will just issue a set of commands (could be drawing a triangle) to the ppu.v
