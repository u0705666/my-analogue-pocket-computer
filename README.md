This repo represents my personal attemp to create a riscv computer

It based on analogue pocket example on their github website
https://github.com/open-fpga/core-example-interact

I may have other things to disctract so I don't know when I will be distracted and when I can get back to this work again. so I will document everything I've for this repo here.


Module list:

ngycore/ngy_computer_top: the top module for my riscv computer. enclosed by core_top
